# meta-analysis: a python package for doing meta-analysis
Meta-analysis is a framework for quantitatively summarizing multiple scientific studies that aim to estimate the same value. It is commonly used to find a statistically valid weight average effect of pharmaceuticals, social programs, and public policies.

The package (and this readme) is currently incomplete.
